Welcome to Project Manager ProÂ®. What can I do for you today?

Available Commands:
  help - Show these commands again
  list - List all projects
  show PID - Show remaining tasks for project with id=PID
  history PID - Show completed tasks for project with id=PID
  mark TID - Mark task with id=TID as complete
    eos

    puts terminal_prompt
    print ">"
    user_response = gets.chomp



    # splitting the user's response into an array separated by spaces
    #
    # will use the array to find what command they put in is, e.g. help, or show - it will be first element in the array
    #
    # also if there's a PID, we we will be able to find it in the next element of the array and use this to get the correct project or task
    #
    response_array = user_response.split(' ')

    # debugging - allows you to see what the response array looks like
    # p response_array

    if response_array[0] == "show"
      project = @projects.find { |proj| proj.id == response_array[1].to_i }
      # debugging - allows you to see what the project object looks like
      # p project
