# In some countries of former Soviet Union there was
# a belief about lucky tickets. A transport ticket
# of any sort was believed to posess luck if sum of
# digits on the left half of its number was equal to
# the sum of digits on the right half. Here are
# examples of such numbers:
#
# 003111    #         3 = 1 + 1 + 1
# 813372    # 8 + 1 + 3 = 3 + 7 + 2
# 17935     #     1 + 7 = 3 + 5
# 56328116  # ???
#
# Such tickets were either eaten after being used
# or collected for bragging rights.
#
# Read the tests carefully and ake them pass.
